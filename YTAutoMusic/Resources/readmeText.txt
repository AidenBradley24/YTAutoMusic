How to use a YTAutoMusic playlist:

Open the XSPF file on your media player of choice. I recommend VLC. https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

If you update the playlist on YouTube, you can open the batch file 'Append Playlist.bat' to automaticly update the local playlist.

Moving the playlist to a different location can break functionality.
The XSPF file and the mp3 files inside the tracks folder should still work, but the batch file won't work anymore.
To fix this, use the copy command in YTAutoMusic.
