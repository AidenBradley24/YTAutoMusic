The idea is that you can give a link to a YouTube music playlist, and it will automatically populate a folder with all the music within audio files. It should also format every file with the correct metadata and name plus which artist / soundtrack it came from. I’d also like it to support quick updates which will check the playlist for new files and add additions if they were not there before. Finally, it will create a VLC playlist for all of the music files.
